## Week 1

### Things to do first
You need to check that python is working on your computer. Here is a summary of the steps (more details are below):
* you will open the command line
* try to run the python interpreter
* create a text file
* enter a python command in the file and save the file
* run the python program you just created from the command line

#### Here are the details

To open the command line click the `Window` button at the bottom of your screen (or press the window key on your keyboard) and type `cmd`. Hit return.
You should see `C:\Users\Admin>`
type `python` or maybe `python3` and hit return.
You should see something like this:

`Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 26 2018, 23:26:24)
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
\>>>`

The first number in the python version needs to be 3, *not 2*

Then type
`exit()`
to leave the python command line.

Now get python running inside a file (normal way to work)
Create a new file in a text editor. To open the editor hit the window key and type `notepad` and hit return. Once Notepad opens click File, Save As. Choose the directory `C:\Users\Admin` and name the file first.py
(The name does not really matter, you just have to remember it for the next step)
Then type this in the file:

`print('Welcome to Coding for Schools')`

Save it again (ctrl+s is a shortcut)

From the command line in the same directory as your python file `C:\Users\Admin` type this:

`python first.py`

and hit return. Ask for help if this does not work.

#### You're all set!
Now you are going to go through an online tutorial. Before we give you the link, here are some things to keep in mind (stuff you can skip):
## Here are some instructions for the tutorial:
You should be able to skip *Lesson 1* - mainly about setting up a small computer called a Raspberry Pi. We will be using laptops, so no need to do this.
Lesson 1 also shows you how to install python. This will be done for you, but it is useful for you to know where to find these instructions for when you are working on your own computer.

*Lesson 2* is good to read through. It is pretty short and gives you an idea of what some of the things are that you are working on in later Lessons.

*Lesson 3* is the real start. You will be telling python what to do.

*Lesson 4* Do this in week 1 too.

## Now here is the link to [the tutorial](http://www.letslearnpython.com/learn/)


### Week 2
Make sure you understand everything from Week 1. This should cover everything that is in Lessons 2-4. Ask for help if you need it.
Now start *Lesson 5*




## You are using python 3, not python 2. Python 2 is old (but still used quite a bit)

If you are having trouble getting python to work on your machine you can take a look at [this page](http://www.letslearnpython.com/learn/lesson/1/step/3/) in the tutorial.

## Once you have some work that you want to keep you should email it to yourself. That way you can continue where you left off next week (or even before)


### Challenge
#### How many words are in Shakespeare's Hamlet?
You will need to know how to read data from a file. Split strings up and use a variable to count.

### Things to cover in class
* Searching for technical answers on the internet
* Find and use the python documentation
* Moving around directories

# Handy tips
## If you want to see the command you just entered in the command line click the up key. You can use the arrow keys to edit this command.
## To switch between windows: Press alt with your thumb and hold it down. Then hit tab and you can switch between windows.
## To save changes to a text file use ctrl+s
