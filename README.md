## Things to do at the start of the class
- Start your computer and log in
- Open a command line
- Run the python interpreter
- Type the hello world program to check that everything is working
- Start your editor
- Save a blank document called `something.py`
- enter the hello world program in `something.py`
- run that program from the command line

# [The tutorial](http://www.letslearnpython.com/learn/)

## Week 1
- Get python running on your machine and start the tutorial

## Week 2
- Go through the start of class checklist (top of page)
- Explanation of what an operating system is
- Searching the internet for technical answers
   - Try basic windows command line
   - what is cd for?
   - what does dir do?
   - How do you make your own directory on a computer?
- Continue with the tutorial


#### Check that python works
To open the command line click the `Window` button at the bottom of your screen (or press the window key on your keyboard) and type `cmd`. Hit return.
You should see `C:\Users\Admin>`
type `python` or maybe `python3` and hit return.
You should see something like this:

`Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 26 2018, 23:26:24)
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
\>>>`

The first number in the python version needs to be 3, *not 2*

Then type
`exit()`
to leave the python command line.

Now get python running inside a file (normal way to work)
Create a new file in a text editor. To open the editor hit the window key and type `notepad` and hit return. Once Notepad opens click File, Save As. Choose the directory `C:\Users\Admin` and name the file first.py
(The name does not really matter, you just have to remember it for the next step)
Then type this in the file:

`print('Welcome to Coding for Schools')`

Save it again

From the command line in the same directory as your python file `C:\Users\Admin` type this:

`python first.py`

and hit return. Ask for help if this does not work.

#### You're all set!
Now you are going to go through an online tutorial. Before we give you the link, here are some things to keep in mind (stuff you can skip):

## Here are some instructions for the tutorial:
You should be able to skip *Lesson 1* - mainly about setting up a small computer called a Raspberry Pi. We will be using laptops, so no need to do this.
Lesson 1 also shows you how to install python.

*Lesson 2* is good to read through. It is pretty short and gives you an idea of what some of the things are that you are working on in later Lessons.

*Lesson 3* is the real start. You will be telling python what to do.
- maths
- floats
- comparison operators

*Lesson 4*
- strings
- operators
- indexes

*Lesson 5*
- variables

*Lesson 6*
- errors


### Challenge
#### How many words are in Shakespeare's Hamlet?
You will need to know how to read data from a file. Split strings up and use a variable to count.
