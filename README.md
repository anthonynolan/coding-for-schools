### Running python
#### First check that python is working on your machine
Open a command line and type `python`
You should see something like this:

`Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 26 2018, 23:26:24)
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
\>>>`


Then type
`exit()`
to leave the python REPL (what's that?).

#### Now get python running inside a file (normal way to work)
Next create a file with the same content as `first_python.py` (or just clone that file)

From the command line in the same directory as your python file type this:

`./first_python.py`

and hit return. Ask for help if this does not work.

#### You're all set!
Then you can continue with [this tutorial](https://www.pythonspot.com/introduction/)

## You are using python 3, not python 2. Python 2 is old (but still used quite a bit)
