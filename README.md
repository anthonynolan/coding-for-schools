## Week 1

### Things to do first
#### Check that python is working on your computer
Open a command line and type `python` or maybe `python3`
You should see something like this:

`Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 26 2018, 23:26:24)
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
\>>>`

The first number in the python version needs to be 3, *not 2*

Then type
`exit()`
to leave the python REPL (what's that?).

#### Now get python running inside a file (normal way to work)
Next create a new file in a text editor. It should contain just this line:

`print('Welcome to Coding for Schools')`

Save it with a name like `first.py`
(The name does not really matter, you just have to remember it for the next step)

From the command line in the same directory as your python file type this:

`python first.py`

and hit return. Ask for help if this does not work.

#### You're all set!
Then you can continue with [this tutorial](http://www.letslearnpython.com/learn/)

## You are using python 3, not python 2. Python 2 is old (but still used quite a bit)

If you are having trouble getting python to work on your machine you can take a look at [this page](http://www.letslearnpython.com/learn/lesson/1/step/3/) in the tutorial.

## Once you have some work that you want to keep you should email it to yourself. That way you can continue where you left off next week (or even before)


### Challenge
#### How many words are in Shakespeare's Hamlet?
You will need to know how to read data from a file. Split strings up and use a variable to count.

### Things to cover in class
* Searching for technical answers on the internet
* Find and use the python documentation
